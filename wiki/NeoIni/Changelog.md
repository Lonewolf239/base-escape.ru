<summary><strong>3.2.1</strong> — March 23, 2026</summary>

#### List of changes

- **Fixed source generator literal formatting** for numeric types and enums in `NeoIniKeyAttribute` default values.  
  Previously, `float`, `decimal`, `uint`, `long`, `ulong` and `enum` values were generated without the required suffix or cast, causing compilation errors.  
  Now the generator correctly emits:
  - `f` for `float`
  - `m` for `decimal`
  - `u` for `uint`
  - `L` for `long`
  - `UL` for `ulong`
  - explicit cast for enums, e.g., `(MyEnum)2`
- **Made `NeoIniEncryptionProvider` public**.  
  The built‑in AES‑256‑CBC encryption provider is now accessible to users who need to reference it directly (e.g., for custom provider composition or testing). Previously it was `internal`.

<details>
<summary><strong>3.2</strong> — March 23, 2026</summary>

#### List of changes

- **Added .NET Standard 2.0 support** – library can now be used on .NET Framework 4.6.2+, .NET Core 2.x, and other platforms compatible with netstandard2.0.
- Conditional compilation for modern APIs (e.g., `Span<T>`, `ValueTask`, `IAsyncDisposable`, `RandomAccess`) with fallback implementations for netstandard2.0.
- Full parity of features across all target frameworks:
  - AES-256 encryption with built‑in `NeoIniEncryptionProvider`
  - Hot reload monitoring
  - Thread‑safe `AsyncReaderWriterLock` adapted for both `ValueTask` and `Task`
  - Human mode (experimental) and shielding
  - Automatic checksum validation and backup creation
- Minor internal optimizations for parsing and serialization.

<summary><strong>3.1</strong> — March 21, 2026</summary>

#### List of changes

- **Breaking change**: `IEncryptionProvider` interface extended with encryption/decryption methods:
  - `void Encrypt(MemoryStream, byte[] key, byte[] salt, byte[] plaintextBytes)`
  - `Task EncryptAsync(MemoryStream, byte[] key, byte[] salt, byte[] plaintextBytes, CancellationToken ct)`
  - `byte[] Decrypt(byte[] key, byte[] iv, byte[] encryptedBytes)`
  - `Task<byte[]> DecryptAsync(byte[] key, byte[] iv, byte[] encryptedBytes, CancellationToken ct)`
- Encryption logic moved from `NeoIniFileProvider` to `NeoIniEncryptionProvider` (built‑in AES implementation)
- `NeoIniFileProvider` now delegates actual encryption/decryption to the `IEncryptionProvider` instance
